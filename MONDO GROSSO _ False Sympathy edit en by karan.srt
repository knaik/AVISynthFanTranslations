1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A secret that no one can find

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A truth that no one can know 

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Our inseparable pair shares a false sympathy

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Beautiful and elegant, yet betraying are flowers 

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Closely resembling someone are these Dahlias flowers

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Everything is about our sweet, deceptive dance

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Give me pain

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A feeling more genuine than love

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Give me your punishment

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So we can stay together

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you 

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
oo so that I can't move

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You know that I’ll never leave you

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Our entwined love

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Falling down

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A paradise for two chained together 

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Give me a wound

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want you to leave a mark

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're the only one I want

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
To keep wanting me too

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A truth about us that no one knows

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The growing hatred you have for me

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I feel invisible chains digging into me

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Helpless flowers plucked by you

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Their nectar giving off the scent of tears

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They shouldn't be touched, with their red enticing fruit

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Give me pain

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A feeling more genuine than love

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Give me your punishment

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So we can stay together

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you, you

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Every time we hold each other

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know that I’ll never leave you

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Entangled in love

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Close your eyes

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Manipulating lies to have our final paradise

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A truth about us that no one knows

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The growing hatred you have for me

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It gives me unconditional comfort no matter where you go

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll become the version of myself that was desired by others

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I wonder if then someday I can love again

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Simple and lonely in this self-delusional sympathy
