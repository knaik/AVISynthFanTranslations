A secret that no one can find
A truth that no one can know 
Our inseparable pair shares a false sympathy

Beautiful and elegant, yet betraying are flowers 
Closely resembling someone are these Dahlias flowers
Everything is about our sweet, deceptive dance
-
Give me pain
	A feeling more genuine than love
Give me your punishment
	So we can stay together

Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you oo so that I can't move
You know that I’ll never leave you
	Our entwined love
-
Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down; 
Falling down
A paradise for two chained together 


Give me a wound
I want you to leave a mark
You're the only one I want
To keep wanting me too
--
A truth about us that no one knows
The growing hatred you have for me
I feel invisible chains digging into me

Helpless flowers plucked by you
Their nectar giving off the scent of tears
They Shouldn't be touched  
The red enticing fruit
---

Give me pain
	A feeling more genuine than love
Give me your punishment
	So we can stay together
-
Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you, you 
every time we hold each other
You know that I’ll never leave you
	Entangled in love

Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down; 
Close your eyes
Manipulating lies to have our final paradise

-

A truth about us that no one knows
The growing hatred you have for me
It gives me unconditional comfort no matter where you go


I'll become the version of myself that was desired by others
I wonder if then someday I can love again
Simple and lonely in this self-delusional sympathy



My translation to my fav song. Its a @MONDOGROSSO_JP / @ShinichiOsawa song. Sultry voice and lustful choreo of @aina_BiSH . @AvexMusic
