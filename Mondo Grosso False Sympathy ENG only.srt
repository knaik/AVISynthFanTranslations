1
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,400
Our secret that you can't reveal

2
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,220
The truth that no one can know

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,100
Our inseparable pair that shares a false sympathy

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,780
Beautiful and elegant, yet deceitful are these flowers 

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,620
Resembling you, these Dahlias flowers

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,740
Everything is between the two of us

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,376
Our sweet, deceptive dance

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,260
Pain

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,260
[Pain] Give it to me

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,100
A feeling more genuine than love

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,100
Your punishment

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,820
I need it from you  

11
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:16,160
So we can stay together

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,580
Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you 

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,020
oo I am so attached to you

14
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,820
You know that I'll never leave you

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,200
Unapologetic  

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,520
[Unapologetic] love

16
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,860
Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down

17
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,360
Falling [down]

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,475
Just two chained together

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,780
together, in paradise

19
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,400
Wound [and scar]

19
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:09,796
[Wound] Me

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,880
I want you to leave a mark

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,180
You're the only one I want

22
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,280
To crave me back

23
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,300
No one will ever understand what we are

24
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,120
The more your hatred grows for me

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,640
I feel the invisible chains dig deeper into me

26
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm a powerless flower plucked by you

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,560
My nectar giving off the scent of my tears

28
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,686
You shouldn't violate me

29
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,080
My alluring red fruit

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,667
Pain

30
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:19,160
[Pain] Give it all to me

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,080
It feels more genuine than love from you

32
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,464
Your punishment

32
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,464
Give it to me

33
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:41,930
So that we'll be bound forever

34
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,420
Tangled up in you, you, you, you, 
you, you, you, you

35
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,360
Every time we hold each other

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,277
You know that I'll never leave you

37
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,864
Entangled in love

38
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,300
Tumbling down, down, down, down, down, down, 
down, down, down, down, down

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,820
Close your eyes

40
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:15,463
Manipulated by lies to save our final paradise

41
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,384
No one can understand everything we've gone through

42
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,221
The more your hatred grows for me

43
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,767
The stronger the hatred, the safer I feel

44
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,720
I'll become whatever you want me to be

45
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,950
Then maybe, someday 

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
I'll be able to love you

46
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,100
Emptiness and Isolation

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,408
False [Self-delusional] Sympathy
